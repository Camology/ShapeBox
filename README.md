# ShapeBox
CSC372 Project 2


This is the repo for a C++ library for creating PostScript files through literal words 
IE : You can say "Box on top of Triangle on top of circle" to generate a document that has those shapes and can be printed on any printer.

The idea of the project is to also learn design patterns as well as further testing pattern development.
